# Python Dependencies for TrackieLLM ATAD Scripts
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file lists all the Python packages required to run the scripts in the
# `scripts/training/` directory, such as `train.py`.
#
# These dependencies are for development and model personalization tasks and
# are NOT required on the target embedded device (Raspberry Pi).
#
# To install all dependencies, run:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#

# --- Core Dependencies for Face Processing ---

# For running ONNX models (face detection and embedding).
onnxruntime

# For image and video processing (webcam capture, resizing, etc.).
opencv-python

# Fundamental library for numerical operations (embeddings, etc.).
numpy

# For displaying progress bars during data collection.
tqdm


# --- Core Dependencies for LLM Fine-Tuning ---

# The main deep learning framework. A specific version with CUDA might be
# needed for GPU acceleration (e.g., torch==2.1.0+cu118).
torch

# Hugging Face's library for downloading and using pre-trained models.
transformers

# Hugging Face's library for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), like LoRA.
peft

# Hugging Face's library to simplify training on different hardware setups.
accelerate

# For loading models with 8-bit and 4-bit quantization, saving memory.
bitsandbytes

# Hugging Face's library for easily handling and processing datasets.
datasets

# For parsing command-line arguments in train.py.
# Note: argparse is part of the standard library in Python 3, but listing it
# here can be useful for older environments or for clarity.
