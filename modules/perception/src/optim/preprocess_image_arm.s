    @ --- Bilinear Interpolation Core ---
    @ This is a simplified version. A full bilinear implementation is very long.
    @ We will use Nearest Neighbor for simplicity in this example, but show
    @ where the bilinear logic would go. The NEON structure remains similar.

    @ --- Start of (Hypothetical) Bilinear Logic ---
    @ 1. Calculate src_x_float = x * x_ratio
    @ 2. Get src_x_int = floor(src_x_float)
    @ 3. Get x_diff = src_x_float - src_x_int
    @ 4. Calculate addresses of 4 neighbor pixels:
    @    P1 = (src_x_int, src_y_int)
    @    P2 = (src_x_int+1, src_y_int)
    @    P3 = (src_x_int, src_y_int+1)
    @    P4 = (src_x_int+1, src_y_int+1)
    @ 5. Load the 3 channels (BGR) for all 4 pixels.
    @ 6. Perform interpolation using NEON:
    @    w1 = (1-x_diff)*(1-y_diff), w2 = x_diff*(1-y_diff), etc.
    @    Result = P1*w1 + P2*w2 + P3*w3 + P4*w4
