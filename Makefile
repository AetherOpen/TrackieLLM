# Makefile for TrackieLLM
# ==============================================================================
#
# This Makefile is a convenience wrapper around the CMake build system.
# It simplifies common development tasks like building, running, and cleaning.
#
# Variables:
#   BUILD_TYPE  - The build type for CMake (Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo).
#                 Default: Release
#   BUILD_DIR   - The directory where all build artifacts will be stored.
#                 Default: build/
#

# --- Configuration ---

# Default build type if not specified by the user.
# Use `make BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to override.
BUILD_TYPE ?= Release

# The directory for all out-of-source build files.
BUILD_DIR ?= build

# The name of the final executable defined in CMake.
TARGET_EXEC = trackiellm

# Use a shell command to get the number of CPU cores for parallel builds.
# On Linux/macOS, `nproc` or `sysctl` works. On Windows (with Git Bash/MSYS), `nproc` is often available.
# Fallback to 4 if the command fails.
CPU_CORES ?= $(shell nproc 2>/dev/null || sysctl -n hw.ncpu 2>/dev/null || echo 4)
